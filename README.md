# Welcome to the Applied HCAI Meetings


## Time: Fridays, 12:00 PM – 1:00 PM PST - Location: TBA (online)


### Our goal is to discuss recent publications and foundational concepts in Applied Human-Centered AI.

No "Homework": You are not expected to read the papers before the meeting.

Mixed Levels Welcome: We structure every session to be accessible to beginners while engaging for experts.

Applied Focus: We don't just look at the math; we look at how these models impact real users in the real world.

### To accommodate different knowledge levels, every session pairs two papers:

The Foundation (Classic): A seminal paper that defines the core concepts and vocabulary.

The Frontier (Modern): A recent paper (2024-2025) showing how those concepts are applied (or failing) today.

### The Hourly Schedule:

12:00 – 12:05: Intros & Announcements.

12:05 – 12:15: Flash Presentations (5 mins each).

Presenter A explains the core definitions (The Foundation).

Presenter B explains the new results (The Frontier).

12:15 – 12:55: Guided Discussion.

Theme: How does the modern application challenge the foundational theory?

12:55 – 1:00: Wrap up.
